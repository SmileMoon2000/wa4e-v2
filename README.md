## Freeware web-based calculation tools for geotechnical engineers

Webappsforengineers are freely available online geotechnical engineering calculation tools based on published research and developed for research dissemination and teaching. The apps enable users to engage with published methods and frameworks immediately, allowing initial sizing calculations to be performed and exploration of the sensitivity of design inputs (e.g. geotechnical properties and loads) on design outputs (e.g. foundation or anchor geometry and resistance). In some cases geometry of the structure is an input, although a key value of many of the automated calculation tools presented in these apps is the ability to change the design question from ‘is the factor of safety for this foundation sufficient?’ to ‘what is the minimum geometry of the foundation to ensure the required factor of safety?’. The latter is arguably the more useful design question and the optimization routines in those tools applying a failure envelope methodology, enable automated iteration to determine the optimized geometry.
